## ðŸŒ€ Overview

This project implements a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** that generates realistic images of handwritten digits using the **MNIST** dataset. The GAN architecture consists of two neural networks:

- **Generator**: Creates images resembling handwritten digits.
- **Discriminator**: Distinguishes between real and generated images.

Together, they compete in a game of adversarial training to improve the quality of generated images.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Trained on the popular **MNIST** dataset of handwritten digits (0-9).
- **Generator** produces grayscale images of size `28x28`.
- **Discriminator** achieves an equilibrium by distinguishing real from fake digits.
- Trained for `X epochs` to achieve stable results.

## ðŸ“Š Architecture

### Generator

The **Generator** uses transposed convolution layers to upsample noise vectors (`z`) into digit-like images.

Key layers:
- Dense layer with a latent space input (`z-dim = 100`).
- Batch Normalization for stability.
- ReLU activation to model non-linearity.
- Transposed Convolution layers for upsampling.

### Discriminator

The **Discriminator** uses convolutional layers to downsample and classify images as real or fake.

Key layers:
- Conv2D layers with LeakyReLU activation for feature extraction.
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
- A Sigmoid output neuron for binary classification.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. **Training Loop**:
    - Generator creates fake images from random noise.
    - Discriminator evaluates real vs. fake images.
    - Loss is calculated for both networks, and weights are updated.
2. **Objective**:
    - Generator minimizes the Discriminator's ability to distinguish fake images.
    - Discriminator maximizes its ability to classify real vs. fake.
